# Mammogram-mass-classification

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning algorithms for predicting whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant. The goal is to provide a comparative analysis of different algorithms to determine their effectiveness in classifying mammogram masses.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Decision Tree**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
4. **Naive Bayes**
5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
6. **Logistic Regression**
7. **Neural Network using Keras**

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models is included in this repository. (Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass)
